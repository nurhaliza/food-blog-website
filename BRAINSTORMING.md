        HEADER : Why did I make this?
            Simply put, I love food. Throughout my childhood, food signified love, passion, and happiness. My ancestors passed on generations of tradition through the food we ate together at the dinner table and sometimes on our bamboo floor mats. I have had the privilege in going to various parts of the world to explore and experience the many delicacies other countries have to proudly offer. I hope that in sharing these recipes and my experiences that you will be able to appreciate the creations of others just as much as I do. :)
